[Our seventh show!](http://randomjabber.blob.core.windows.net/podcast/minimallyviable_podcast-v0.0.7.mp3)

[Michael](https://twitter.com/migreene) and [Steven](https://twitter.com/stevenmurawski) start talking about enterprise IT pro's vs mid/small market IT pro's, but veer off to talking about transforming the view of IT to being part of the value stream.
