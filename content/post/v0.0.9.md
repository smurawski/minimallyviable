After a long hiatus, [our ninth show!](http://randomjabber.blob.core.windows.net/podcast/minimallyviable_podcast-v0.0.9.mp3)

[Michael](https://twitter.com/migreene) and [Steven](https://twitter.com/stevenmurawski) talk about what happens when you have to change priorities, which may leave some stakeholders unhappy.
